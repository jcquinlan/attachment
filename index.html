             <p class="statement">.attachment is a small collection of transcribed love letters curated in an effort to examine the expression of our thoughts and feelings. I was curious how written word would situate itself when removed from it's original context, how we attach meaning to what we say, and where that meaning manifests itself. <a class="link" href="info.html">Read here for more information.</a></br><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></p>

               <p class="noteBody">My Dearest Fuckface,</br></br>Lately I've been thinking about you often. First thing in the morning, and last thing before I sleep. Your photo is right next to my alarm clock, so I see you first thing every morning. Wouldn't that be nice? Waking up every morning next to eachother naked. I'd make coffee and maybe learn to cook you something decent. Ah! Toast! Or maybe a quesodilla? I dunno. I want to fall asleep next to you. I want to fit my body into yours again like the puzzle pieces we are. I can feel it at night when I sleep.I know where my head would be relative to your torso and where my hand would lay and how my legs would wrap around yours. </br></br>I know you don't believe me, but no one compares to you. Nobody tells me I'm a human girl when I say I'm a cat (they agree with me! Ha! I knew it!). I can't trust anyone the way I trust you. I just can't. I can't allow myself to. I must have known something somehow when I put so much trust in you so early. I don't trust people usually. Being here with all new people has reminded me just how closed off I really am. People acknowledge it. They know me as the girl they know nothing about. They know me as the apathetic girl who hates affection and sold her soul for a container of hummus. I've been told I'm a mystery. </br></br>To everyone except you.</br></br><span class="center">___________</span></p>

               <p class="noteBody">I love you, you tool. I miss your graffiti. I miss seeing your art (I love showing it off to my friends). I miss how your house smells, that bread baking smell. I miss your sister. I miss smoking cigarettes on the back of my Lexus outside of your house. I miss giving you head (but really, I do...). I miss touching your lips while you talk to me. I can picture your room in my head better than I can picture my own. I miss the smell of pipe tobacco. I love you. </br></br>We have had so many sad memories, I want to add to the happy ones. I want to be an adult with you. I want to live in Europe or New York City with you. I want a love like my parents'. I want to come home at night and pour myself a glass of wine and snuggle and talk about our days.</br></br>I want to apologize for some things. I want to apologize for loving you when it's convenient. I want to apologize for the inconsistency. But please understand that I'm loving you as much as my little heart can. I don't have a lot of love to give out. You have so much, I know, but I'm different from you. So always remember that it's never your fault if I suck. It's just me as a person. I feel like the gaps in affection you feel would be filled if I were by you. They'd be filled by our nonverbal communication. Please just know that my heart isn't cold, it just beats slow.</br></br>I just love you as much as a stoic heart can bear to love. Which, I guess, isn't all that much. But it's a fuckton for me.</br></br><span class="center">___________</span></p>

That's why I haven't heard from you. That's cool! But you don't have to kick me to the curve though, I understand how it is sometimes. Nigga put his foot down! I probably would have done the same. </br></br>Can't blame the brotha cause you is a sexy mothafucker. Can you come out to the house? Do he allow you to talk on the phone? Sounds like you are a hostage. Nigga put a pad lock on the doors. Well I hope you are happy with him. I don't want you to get your ass whipped by him for writing me okay. I hope you invite me to the wedding. I thought it was going to be you and mewhen I get out in a couple of months. I was looking forward to hugging you and kissing you. And holding hands with you. It's driving me crazy knowing another man is getting all my hugs and kisses from you. There ain't no reason to come home now.</br></br>Happy New Year!</br></br><span class="center">___________</span></p>

I wish I could write like you but my handwriting sucks. Really badly. So I think I'm going to have to start tpying these. Oh well.</br></br>So you're in math right now... we just finished a test so it's all quiet and peaceful. I'm pretty sure I failed but it's all good. It was on Unit 2? I think? I don't know... So yep... I hate math. I can't wait for art last block today! I love seeing you. It makes my day worth it all.</br></br>But I do have a reason for writing to you... It's about me... and my spasms of like doubt and sadness. I can't really help it. Just sometimes I think about how incredible you are... and how much I don't deserve you. Then I get all self conscious. Like last night, I went to shower and I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror. I'm just crazy maybe...

I know for awhile that there's gonna be a lot of distance that separates me from you and all the other people that I'm closest to but seriously, it's just distance. I'm gonna continue to be there for you NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. haha. for real though. Always remember that it doesn't matter where I am in this world that you're so beautiful and an ocean of amazing.
