             <p class="statement">.attachment is a small collection of transcribed love letters curated in an effort to examine the expression of our thoughts and feelings. I was curious how written word would situate itself when removed from it's original context, how we attach meaning to what we say, and where that meaning manifests itself. <a class="link" href="info.html">Read here for more information.</a></br><img class="arrow" src="arrow.png"></p>

               <p class="noteBody">My Dearest Fuckface,</br></br>Lately I've been thinking about you often. First thing in the morning, and last thing before I sleep. Your photo is right next to my alarm clock, so I see you first thing every morning. Wouldn't that be nice? Waking up every morning next to eachother naked. I'd make coffee and maybe learn to cook you something decent. Ah! Toast! Or maybe a quesodilla? I dunno. I want to fall asleep next to you. I want to fit my body into yours again like the puzzle pieces we are. I can feel it at night when I sleep.I know where my head would be relative to your torso and where my hand would lay and how my legs would wrap around yours. </br></br>I know you don't believe me, but no one compares to you. Nobody tells me I'm a human girl when I say I'm a cat (they agree with me! Ha! I knew it!). I can't trust anyone the way I trust you. I just can't. I can't allow myself to. I must have known something somehow when I put so much trust in you so early. I don't trust people usually. Being here with all new people has reminded me just how closed off I really am. People acknowledge it. They know me as the girl they know nothing about. They know me as the apathetic girl who hates affection and sold her soul for a container of hummus. I've been told I'm a mystery. </br></br>To everyone except you.</br></br><span class="center">___________</span></p>

               <p class="noteBody">I love you, you tool. I miss your graffiti. I miss seeing your art (I love showing it off to my friends). I miss how your house smells, that bread baking smell. I miss your sister. I miss smoking cigarettes on the back of my Lexus outside of your house. I miss giving you head (but really, I do...). I miss touching your lips while you talk to me. I can picture your room in my head better than I can picture my own. I miss the smell of pipe tobacco. I love you. </br></br>We have had so many sad memories, I want to add to the happy ones. I want to be an adult with you. I want to live in Europe or New York City with you. I want a love like my parents'. I want to come home at night and pour myself a glass of wine and snuggle and talk about our days.</br></br>I want to apologize for some things. I want to apologize for loving you when it's convenient. I want to apologize for the inconsistency. But please understand that I'm loving you as much as my little heart can. I don't have a lot of love to give out. You have so much, I know, but I'm different from you. So always remember that it's never your fault if I suck. It's just me as a person. I feel like the gaps in affection you feel would be filled if I were by you. They'd be filled by our nonverbal communication. Please just know that my heart isn't cold, it just beats slow.</br></br>I just love you as much as a stoic heart can bear to love. Which, I guess, isn't all that much. But it's a fuckton for me.</br></br><span class="center">___________</span></p>

That's why I haven't heard from you. That's cool! But you don't have to kick me to the curve though, I understand how it is sometimes. Nigga put his foot down! I probably would have done the same. </br></br>Can't blame the brotha cause you is a sexy mothafucker. Can you come out to the house? Do he allow you to talk on the phone? Sounds like you are a hostage. Nigga put a pad lock on the doors. Well I hope you are happy with him. I don't want you to get your ass whipped by him for writing me okay. I hope you invite me to the wedding. I thought it was going to be you and mewhen I get out in a couple of months. I was looking forward to hugging you and kissing you. And holding hands with you. It's driving me crazy knowing another man is getting all my hugs and kisses from you.

               <p class="noteBody">Would you want to read this? Would it make you cringe, so uncomfortable and ruined? I’ve just got to tell you something out loud, or on paper. I’ve got to get something out there.</br></br>First off, I would like to define us in boundaries we already exist in. Really connected we are - ridiculous how fast it all happened, yeah? It’s like I always dream about you (but don’t, this is a similie) because I always feel that magic when with you, ya know. I think you described it as a really intense platonic love - which is really on point. I remember in the beginnings of us hanging out and running and librarying, I was talking to her I realized wow, I really love him. Like a really intense platonic love from the start.</br></br>But something changed after 25 - but I’ve been quiet, and hiding silent. There is a feeling as if you are a puzzle piece to me. This is a confession of sorts, although I don’t want all of it. I don’t want anything but an out there, upfront relationship. When you talk to me I feel so fulfilled so happy, aflutter. But sometimes, lots of times, when I talk to you I feel big, insecure, and distrustful. It’s because the me that you know (the one that loves you only as much as you love her) does not exist. It’s hard for me to be that girl, especially from far away. I filter myself. Wouldn’t want to say anything or do anything that hinted at the way I feel. Even worse, I have recently been questioning your love for me intensely. It’s that horrible insecurity - believing the people who love you most actually hate you. Without the honesty we are only connected, but we don’t know each other. Because really knowing someone - there is no fear or shadow. I want to pull away from you, it’s hard for me and it does not become easier. The cosmos has made things very pointy for me.

               <p class="noteBody">Right now I’m in Spanish, this is how all my letters start from Spanish class. Today we had to write directions in Spanish. I wrote my directions to the art hallway. Well, our art room more specifically. They sucked so bad, my teacher was like “I think this person needs to practice.” I’m like super embarrassed because she’s reading them to the class (and we have to guess where they end up). Of course mine are the worst. We have a pals test next class that I am not looking forward to. We’ve wasted 45 minutes doing this. I’m so tempted to play with my iPod, but I won’t. I’ll do that in history. I wanna show Mrs. Chadrow the brushes app really bad. Haha. Oh Fuck. In front of the entire class Mrs. Vigneant goes “Where did your directions go to?” And I’m pretty sure I was redder than a tomato.</br></br>She keeps slipping in and out of my mind. When I’m not think of her, I instantly think of her again. Then I feel bad for not thinking about her before. I know it’s not my fault it happened, but if I could, I’d do anything to make it better.</br></br>I keep thinking of the “Shooting the Moon” lyrics and the “Breakeven” lyrics (by The Script). That’s how I feel right now. “I’m still alive but I’m barely breathin’/ Just praying to a god that I don’t believe in.”</br></br>Today I didn’t believe in 6 impossible things before breakfast. I need to work on that. I guess nothing is really impossible when you think about it. Did you know we don’t know what causes gravity? What kind of force could cause that? To be constantly attracting things towards it, all sorts of things too. Is there anything that really defies gravity? Nothing ever completely defies it. Weird.</br></br>Gotta go :) class is over! Thank god!

               <p class="noteBody">L,</br></br>I get anxious when I haven’t heard from you in a while. My mind mulls best and worst cases and, all in all, it always comes to nothing. I could blame the past, but for the sake of history. I remember your sister said that love is about making it work. And how I didn’t agree at first. Am I a fool? Worse, a dependent fool. I cannot focus without you.</br></br>On another note, frequently I doubt my friends’ genuinity, and even favor.</br></br>It’s not fair that you came back to me when I was indifferent and now I am emotionally vulnerable all over again. </br></br>I don’t think I am asking more of you than is normal behavior for a boyfriend.
