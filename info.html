             <p class="statement">.attachment was created after an enduring struggle in trying to situate the meaning of text within the scope of all other experiences outside of oneself. Simply put, .attachment is the posing of a question: Where is the meaning of my words in relation to my words? If these words are simply repeated is that same meaning present? If not, do the words lack this meaning all together? Love letters were originally chosen as subject material due to their highly emotional nature, and I assumed that something allegedly infused with  enormous amounts of emotion would be easier to keep track of, like a beacon of light in the distance. </br></br>I found over time that love letters simply exposed what I believe to be the unavoidable tendency of written word to mask or distort the intent of the author. Recurring clichés and childish, dramatic expressions of desire revealed that these love letters often seemed ingenuine or, at best, an earnest attempt to express a sliver of the complicated spectrum of human emotion. </br></br>When a letter is written from the most vulnerable recesses of one’s being can words ever truly convey the abstract physical and emotional nuances of that mindset? Can words ever evoke the plethora of qualia experienced when confronting and embracing one’s love for another? And can that ever be used to simulate these moments between one another?</br><a href="index.html"><img class="arrow" src="arrow2.png"></a></p>
